# Linux-SysAdmin-Bashscript
Bash script to automate admin, user, group, and permission management for a specific problem space.

My goals for this project were to meet all requirements in the rubric and, as a challenge, solve anticipated pain points for marking.

When creating and testing this script I found the process of cleaning up users, groups and permissions to be necessary to ensure proper testing. 

I also found it annoying.

I assumed this would be the experice of whoever had to grade my script. To address this I created methods to sanitize anything left behind by the script or the scripts of other students (assuming they followed the rubric's requirements).

In addition, to make the marking/testing process easier, I added optional methods to print feedback to the commandline.
